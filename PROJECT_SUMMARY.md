## Current State

The site is fully functional and will display helpful "getting started" messages until you configure Sanity CMS and add content. Once you add content:

- Homepage will show featured projects and blog posts
- All listing pages will display your content
- Individual project/post pages will show full details
- Navigation and footer are fully functional
- All pages are responsive and accessible

## Next Steps

### 1. Set Up Sanity CMS (Required)

Follow the instructions in **[SETUP.md](./SETUP.md)** to:

1. Create a Sanity project at [sanity.io](https://sanity.io)
2. Get your Project ID and create an API token
3. Configure environment variables in `.env.local`
4. Set up Sanity Studio (embedded or standalone)
5. Deploy your schemas

**Quick Start:**
```bash
# Copy environment variables template
cp .env.local.example .env.local

# Edit .env.local with your Sanity credentials
# Then start the dev server
npm run dev
```

### 2. Add Your First Content

Once Sanity is configured:
- Add your first project (UI or Art)
- Write an About page entry
- Publish a blog post
- Mark some content as "featured" to highlight on homepage

### 3. Future Enhancements (Optional)

Consider these improvements based on your needs:

**Phase 4: Component Library**
- Create reusable `<ProjectCard>` component

- Add `<ImageGallery>` for project details
- Implement `<FilterTabs>` for project filtering

**Phase 5: Rich Text Rendering**
- Install `@portabletext/react`
- Create custom components for rendering Sanity rich text
- Add syntax highlighting for code blocks
- Custom image components with captions

**Phase 6: Advanced Features**
- Search functionality
- Pagination for large content lists
- Related projects/posts suggestions
- RSS feed for blog
- Analytics integration
- Open Graph images for social sharing
- Contact form

**Phase 7: Performance Optimization**
